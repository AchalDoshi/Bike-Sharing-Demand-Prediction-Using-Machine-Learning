# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This project was completed in parital fulfillment for the award of the degree of **Bachelor of Science**.

## Project Highlights

1. Conducted an in-depth study and analysis of a real-world bike-sharing dataset to apply machine learning techniques for demand prediction.

2. Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and variable correlations affecting bike-sharing usage.

3. Implemented and evaluated multiple regression algorithms:
   - Lasso Regression  
   - Ridge Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
   - XGBoost  
   - LightGBM  
   - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

4. Applied feature engineering techniques and used stratified random sampling for balanced training/testing datasets.

5. Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics.

6. Identified and recommended the best-performing regression model for accurate bike-sharing demand forecasting.
